# Placeholder for command icon
#
# To complete the extension, you need to add a command-icon.png file here.
# The icon should be:
# - 512x512 pixels
# - PNG format
# - Represents a dictionary or book (📖 or 📚)
#
# You can:
# 1. Design one yourself
# 2. Use an emoji as icon (export as PNG)
# 3. Download from icon resources like SF Symbols
#
# For now, you can use an emoji converter or create a simple icon.
